# Challenge Summary

In this challenge, I was assigned to "refactor", or improve, the code using a set of guidelines that adhere to semantic structuring. I changed much of the HTML tags that were provided to begin with from non-semantic div tags to appropriate HTML tags for each element.

I enjoyed learning and understanding how this firt lesson of web design shapes the web!
